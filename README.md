This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution. The original Dockerfile fails to build because it attempts to copy a `requirements.txt` file that does not exist in the build context or has an incorrect path specified in the COPY instruction. The solution demonstrates the correct way to specify the file path and ensure the requirements file is present.
